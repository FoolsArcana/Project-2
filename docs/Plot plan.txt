// We are creating  Multi- Line Graph with temperature information, d3/plotly will likely be the tool to use
//Line graph will have this data:
// y will = temperature
// x will = hours of that specific day
// Lines will be actual temperature, temperature that was predicted for that time the day before, temperature predicted the week before, and bonus: last year's hourly temperature.
//tool tip will calculate the accuracy percentage by the actual temperature of the hour
// actual temperature will be a line that does not end until the end of the day.

guests can select a box and whiskers plot using the same data

//////

//Using leaflet and timeline plug in show weather for 3 days or 7 days forecasted with a drop down out including icons of rain, snow, hail etc...
Timeline will be hourly based and move icons around the map based on the hour and location of issues
Bind click event will tell you the temperature, wind speed, chance of precipitation

//Using reagan national airport's weather station as a center, gather one year's worth of (daily) data from weather.gov to create a graph using the vega weather bubble plot
We will be plotting maximum daily temperature (y), by day (x) using months as the x-tick, with weather phenomena (sun, snow, rain, fog, drizzle), and precipitation as the size of the circle.

A horizontal bar chart will be placed underneath to describe the weather phenomena (sun, snow, rain, fog, drizzle) with the number of records of that phenomena.


/////

Daily trend of past month with temperature or precipitation to plot

Line chart  temperature = y, day = x or precipitation = y, day = x.
